	<p> Okay, I suppose this calls for an introduction: </p>
	
	<p> My name is Ali, writing and programming are my main two hobbies. I'm going to use this website
	to post everything that I code/write so it's safe in case my laptop dies or something.
	My writing is fairly bog standard for a thirteen year old, but I like to think I can code slightly better. </p>
	
	<p> I have been learning Python since January 2017, and I'm thinking about getting into software development or cybersecurity
	when I'm older. I don't really know. </p>
	
	<p> So, yeah. Thirteen years old, wannabe programmer, hobbyist writer and gamer from England.</p>
	
	<p> Oh, almost forgot: </p>
	
	<p> I told my friend to pick a random verb, and I added my birth day (4th), so yeah that's my name on GitHub,
	which I'll also use here. I do have other names in other places, though. Which you'll never know muahahaha. </p>
